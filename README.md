# Silicon_Sample_Affective_Polarization
This repository contains code for generating synthetic samples (silicon samples) for a political survey experiment on affective polarization. In the synthetic sampling process, the LLM first adopts different personas defined by demographic and political characteristics and then takes the survey experiment as these different personas. The responses that the LLMs give are referred to as silicon samples or synthetic data. 

The code and experiment are adapted from Levendusky’s (2018) study on priming national identity to reduce affective polarization. The repository includes: 
* Code for generating synthetic samples (silicon samples) to run on experimental surveys 
* Code for generating audit data to use as “personas” for the synthetic samples.
